Central repository to keep base `configure.xml` and all its shameful trickery.

=== Ant targets

TODO: Describe it before Sun goes nova.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-stage`: build the stage with Apache Karaf ready to run the examples
* `ant build-all`: builds all available subprojects;
* `ant clean`: removes the `build` and `dist` directories;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools;
* `ant configure`: rebuild the library and tools cache.

== Key Directories and Files

Important directories to be aware of:

* `cache` - stores the downloaded jars, custom tasks and other tools;
* `stage` - the local Apache Karaf installation built to test the subprojects.

== Important Resources

Although these references are almost everywhere, they are important here because we're heavily OSGi-oriented.

Be aware that you can find a lot more features to build OSGi projects on BND Tools.

Marcond's notes: Unfortunatelly I'm still not prepared to deal with my addiction to Ant, that's why it's used. There are no religious issues here :)
